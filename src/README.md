For this project we used the `Model-View-Controller` (MVC) architectural pattern. 

## Why?
A MVC is useful for developing user interfaces, it divides the application into three interconnected parts. The MVC design decouples major components allowing for code reuse, and parallel development. Thus, it seemed the logical choice in order to streamline our group's workflow.

## Components
### Model
The model component corresponds to all the data-related logic that the user works with. This ca represent the data that is being transferred between the `View` and `Controller` components or any other project logic-related data.

### View
The view component is used for all the UI logic of the application. In this case, mainly the interface the student's use.

### Controller
controllers act as an interface between `Model` and `View` components to process all the project logic and incoming requests, manipulat edata using the `Model` component and interact with the `Views` to render the final output.
