# Contributing
This is a basic outline of how to add code to this repository Generally, a contributing file on Github is used when people submit pull requests or create issues - we will be using them as a way to simplify the structure of our development pipeline.

## Starting up
Go to the folder you want to develop in and run:
'''
git clone https://github.com/AngusTheMack/SQLmark.git
'''
This will download the files from the SQLmark directory and add them to your working direction.

This will also set the branch to **master**. In order to check if everything worked you can simply `cd` into SQLmark and run `git status`
