# Documentation
We have created a Wiki on our project's Github page - please refer to it [here](https://github.com/AngusTheMack/SQLmark/wiki) to see our documentation in depth.

In the [pdf](/pdf) folder there are PDFs which are copies of the Wiki at the point in time.

Otherwise, we used JavaDocs in order to make and maintain documentation for our project code.
