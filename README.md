### Project Description
This project will develop a system to create and mark SQL assignments. A database of questions (data access requests in English) and answers (SQL SELECT statements to retrieve that data) will be created. Some question-answer pairs will be input by the lecturer and the system will generate more based on these exemplars. It will then generate a set of assignments and assign each student in the class one of the assignments in that set – i.e. the assignment each student is given depends on their student number. It will also store in its database the data to be queried, some of which will be provided by the lecturer and some generated by the system. Finally, it will accept student submissions (lists of SQL SELECT statements) and return the student’s mark along with some indication of how their output differs from expected output.
