This is the repository for our CSC3003S Capstone Project, AKA `SQLmark` If you want to contribute, please review the [Contributing](/contributing.md) file, in order to know what specifications to adhere to.
## Brief Project Description
We aimed to develop a system to create and mark SQL assignments for CSC2002S at UCT. Question-answer pairs will be input by the lecturer. It will then generate a set of assignments and assign each student in the class one of the assignments in that set. Finally, it will accept student submissions, and return the studentâ€™s mark along with some indication of how their output differs from expected output.

### Further Information
#### Basic Functionality
1. Lecturer inputs CSV files of:
    * Student numbers 
    * Data for DB
    * Sample Questions, where each row has 3 values
        * The question
        * The answer
        * The difficulty level
2. Student interface for doing the assignment
    * Students can login
    * System generates random assignment comprising several questions
    * Each question done in turn
    * Each question marked
    * Student told total for the assignment at the end

## Project Structure
This directory has three folders which are important. [src](/src), [test](/test) and [docs](/docs). The `src` directory, contains all the code for our project. It is laid out in the MVC architectural pattern. The `test` directory includes the tests for our code, and the `docs` directory contains our documentation for our code. The `lib` directory contains the dependencies needed for our code, the `projectImages` directory contains images we used in our project and the `db` directory contains files needed for the DB.

The `.csv` files in the project root, are the ones used for demoing functionality.
