## Brief Project Description
We aim to develop a system to create and mark SQL assignments. A database of questions and answers will be created. Some question-answer pairs will be input by the lecturer and the system will generate more based on these exemplars. It will then generate a set of assignments and assign each student in the class one of the assignments in that set. Finally, it will accept student submissions, and return the studentâ€™s mark along with some indication of how their output differs from expected output.

### Further Information

1. Lecturer inputs CSV files of:
    * Student numbers

    * Sample Questions, where each row has 3 values
        * The question
        * The answer
        * The difficulty level
2. Student interface for doing the assignment
    * Student Login
    * System generates random assignment comprising several questions
    * Each question done in turn
    * Each question marked
    * Student told total for the assignment at the end
#### Extra Functionality
1. Add Automation for Lecturer
    * Generate db data based on example
    * Generate questions based on example
    * generate data & questsions with different scenarious
2. Make it harder for students to copy/cheat in anyway

This directory has three folders which are important. [src](/src), [test](/test) and [docs](/docs). The `src` directory, contains all the code for our project. It is laid out in the MVC architectural pattern. The `test` directory includes the tests for our code, and the `docs` directory contains our documentation for our code.
